Based on FiranMUX code when it was in GPL, revised by JadeMUSH, This project will contain two branches. JadeMUSH and EasyInstall. JadeMUSH will contain the current version of all the softcode for JadeMUSH, and EasyInstall will contain a version of the JadeMUSH softcode, for those who don't know much softcode at all. EasyInstall will be updated infrequently, and initially, won't have anythign in it, until the head coder of JadeMUSH, or another coder, has time to convert code.
